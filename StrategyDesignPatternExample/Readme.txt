- Strategy Design Pattern -

What:
A Strategy Design pattern is a behavioral pattern.

Why:
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them easy interchangeable.
It is also very easy to add algorithms.

How:
By abstracting the interchanging of algorithm-objects.

Real World Examples:
- Software that uses differenct kinds of encrypting-algorithms which can easily be exchanged.
- In a game you have different bonuses that you can get, each bonus has its own value-algorithm.
- An application has employees with different job functions, each function has a its own salary-algorithm.
